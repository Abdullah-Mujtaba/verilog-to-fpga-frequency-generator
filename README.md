# verilog-to-fpga-frequency-generator
This repository contains a complete Verilog FPGA signal chain built for a Digital Systems Design Complex Engineering Problem (CEP): a Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS) generates sine waves at configurable frequencies, which are then processed by a low-pass FIR filter. The filtered samples are converted to a PWM stream for output on FPGA hardware.
